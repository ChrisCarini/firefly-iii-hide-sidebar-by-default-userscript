Want the sidebar in <a href="https://www.firefly-iii.org/">Firefly III</a> to be hidden by default when you load the page?

This user script is for you.

Unfortunately, there will not be a native Firefly III feature implemented to hide the sidebar by default - see <a href="https://github.com/firefly-iii/firefly-iii/issues/9735">firefly-iii/firefly-iii#9735</a> for details. This user script is a workaround to achieve this functionality.
